The solution involves carefully analyzing the order and combination of responsive classes.  You may need to rearrange them, use more specific modifiers, or simplify the class structure. The key is to understand how Tailwind's cascade and specificity work with responsive modifiers.  In complex cases, using Tailwind's utilities for explicitly managing order (such as `!important`) might be necessary, but only as a last resort and with careful consideration of potential unintended consequences. For the example, simplifying the class structure from overlapping and potentially conflicting `@screen` directives to a more straightforward approach resolved the issue.  Thorough testing on different screen sizes is crucial.
