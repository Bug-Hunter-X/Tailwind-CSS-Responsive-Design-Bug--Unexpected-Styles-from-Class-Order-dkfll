This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with complex responsive designs.  Suppose you have a component with multiple responsive classes applied using `@screen` directives. If there's an error in the order or combination of these classes, Tailwind might not apply styles as expected, leading to unexpected visual results or layout issues.  The problem is often difficult to debug because the error isn't immediately obvious in the browser's developer tools; the styles *appear* to be applied but the visual outcome is incorrect.  This is especially true when dealing with nested responsive modifiers.
